// Page Vs Posts - It depends on us how we are using these content types and no specific rule to build. But prefernce are there.

## WP supports 2 main types of content : Posts & Pages

* Post 
- Newest to Oldest
- Typically dated
- Often have comments
- Organised with tags and categories
- Used to publish central content of thier site (regular basis).

* Pages
- More static
- They don't have category or tags 
- Don't showup on blog archive.
- Permenat things that are not time sensitive, keep in the same place for a long time.


// Categories and tags
- They are managed under Menu:Post.
- They works in very much the same way.
- Helpful for organising our posts. (Viewing related content on your website - Giving them assecc to other similar contents.)
- URL : website.com/category/category_3/
      : website.com/tag/tag_7/

- Difference 
: Every port must be attached to atleast a category, but not neccecary for tag. If not assigned then default one will be used.
: Categories have hierarcy. {Parent category - more subcategories} But tags are all on same level.
: Categories broad groupings - tags tend to be used for much more specific topics.
: Categories - {Food : Indian}, Tags - {Biriyani}


// Navigation menus 

- Dashboard Menu : Apperance : Menus : Edit Menu
- Then with the help of 'Add menu items' & 'Menu Structure' : Rearrange, Add, Remove, Create New.

- Dashboard Menu : Apperance : Menus : Manage Location
- With the help of this manage the location of menus. {Primary, Secondary, Footer, Mobile}
- Here menu names are displayed as option which can be edited by "Edit Menu".


// Widgets
